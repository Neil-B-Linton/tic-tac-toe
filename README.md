## Project Specs

This is a refactored project from school that is still in development - formatted through REACT.js instead of vanilla javascript/html/css.
It utilizes custom hooks which both help the game logic itself in dictating turns, wins, and whether or not the game is decidedly a draw. 
This will be in turn created in a fullscale application, which will allow users to play either on the same PC/mobile device or on seperate devices.
The small portion of the MVP has already been reached, which was to make the game itself completely functional from a single device.
